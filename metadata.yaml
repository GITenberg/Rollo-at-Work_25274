description: '"The Rollo books: A lively collection of stories about Rollo and his
  every day adventures in growin up in 19th century rural America, that have delighted
  generations of children... The scenes are laid in quiet and virtuous life, and the
  character and conduct described are generally--with the exception of some of the
  ordinary exhibitions of childish folly--character and conduct to be imitated, for
  it is generally better, in dealing with children, to allure them to what is right
  by agreeable pictures of it, than to attempt to drive them to it by repulsive delineations
  of what is wrong." -- cover.'
